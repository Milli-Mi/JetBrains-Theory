## Theory: World Wide Web
### *1.What is the Web?*

The **World Wide Web** is a collection of information resources scattered around the world and linked together by reference. Sometimes this term is shortened to WWW, W3 or simply Web.

A unit of hypertext data on the W3 is called a **web page**. A web page may contain text, media files, graphics and links to other pages.

A group of Web pages that share a common content theme, design and links to each other is called a **website**. Special programs — **browsers** — are used to download and browse these websites. Most popular browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari.

Often when you visit sites, you can see "**www**" in the address bar of the browser:

This prefix indicates that the address of the website belongs to the Internet space of the World Wide Web and is not mandatory.


### *2.Internet vs WWW*
Most people use the terms "Internet" and "WWW" interchangeably, but in fact, these are two separate notions. The **Internet** is a global computer network, i.e., a technical infrastructure that connects millions of computers around the world. While W3 is used to distribute data that contains links to other data, the Internet connects computers to each other to provide access to the information.


### *3.Conclusion*
Simply put, the World Wide Web is a way of obtaining information over the Internet, yet the Internet is also used to access information that is not a part of the Web. Hypertext documents - web pages are the units of the "WWW". They may include different content and are usually joined by a shared topic and links into websites. Specific programs called browsers can download websites, so we can explore them.
