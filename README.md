## What is the Web?

The **World Wide Web** is a collection of information resources scattered around the world and linked together by reference. Sometimes this term is shortened to WWW, W3 or simply Web.

A unit of hypertext data on the W3 is called a **web page**. A web page may contain text, media files, graphics and links to other pages.

A group of Web pages that share a common content theme, design and links to each other is called a **website**. Special programs — **browsers** — are used to download and browse these websites. Most popular browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari.

Often when you visit sites, you can see "**www**" in the address bar of the browser:

This prefix indicates that the address of the website belongs to the Internet space of the World Wide Web and is not mandatory.
